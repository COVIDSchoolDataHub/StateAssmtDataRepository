This is a ReadMe for Louisiana's data cleaning process, from 2015 to 2023.


## Setup

There are four folders you need to create: 
Original Data Files, NCES, Output, and Temporary Data Files. 

Download all of the files from the LA "Original Data Files for Version 1.1." Place them in the "Original Data Files" folder. The code also works with the NCES .dta files.

## Code

Each year from 2015 to 2023 has its own do file which can be run in any order.
