# South Carolina Data Cleaning

This is a ReadMe for South Carolina's data cleaning process, from Spring 2016 to Spring 2023 





## Setup

There are three folders you need to create: 
Original Data Files, Intermediate, Output.

Download the original .xlsx files and place them into the "Original Data Files" folder. 

There is 1 .do file. You can run the entire file at once.

(The NCESOld file should be the most recent available NCES files.)

    
## File Path

The file path setup should be as follows: 

```bash
global path "/Users/minnamgung/Desktop/SADR/South Carolina"
global nces "/Users/minnamgung/Desktop/SADR/NCESOld"
```
