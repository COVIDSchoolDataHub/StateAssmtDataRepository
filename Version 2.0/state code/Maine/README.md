# Maine Data Cleaning

This is a ReadMe for Maine's data cleaning process, from 2015 to 2023.

## Recreating Cleaning Process
- Two options for first step: 
1. (recommended) Download original data in .csv format directly from the drive under the "Separated by year" folder. This will save you the 20 minutes it takes stata to import and convert the .xlsx files to .csv format
2. Download the "true" original data in .xlsx format. Run the "Splitting by year" do-file. This will create the .csv files in the drive folder.

- After downloading and setting directories in all do-files in github, run the ME_Master.do file. It is necessary to run this file to fully recreate the cleaning process as there are additions to each year inside that do-file.

- To make changes, you should probably add them to the yearly do-files as opposed to the master do-file just for clarity, but it doesn't matter too much.
