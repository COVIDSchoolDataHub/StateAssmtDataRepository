# IA Readme 

## Process

You should run six do files in the following order: 

Iowa_NCES_clean.do,

ITBS_clean_pre2015.do,

IA_post2015_clean.do,

IA_EDFactsParticipation_2014_2021.do,

IA_EDFactsParticipation_2022.do,

IA_StableNames.do.

Download the Iowa folder from Google Drive, and all files you will need to reference will be sorted into the correct subpaths.  You will then need to add a subfolder called "Intermediate" to the Iowa folder and change the part of the global file paths to reference the correct places on your computer.  You will also need to create a folder for NCES Data with one subfolder for district data, one subfolder for school data, and one folder for cleaned data.

Benjamin Moshes and Mira Mehta were the last editors; feel free to contact them at benjamin_moshes@brown.edu or mira_mehta1@brown.edu.
