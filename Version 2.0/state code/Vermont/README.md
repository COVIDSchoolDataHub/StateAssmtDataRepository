# Vermont Data Cleaning

This is a ReadMe for Vermont's data cleaning process, from 2016 to 2023.


## Setup
Create a folder for Vermont. Inside that folder, create four more folders: 
"Original Data", "State_Output", "New_Output", and "EdFacts"

1. Download do-files and place them in the VT folder.
2. Download the "Datasets" folder in the EDFacts folder under _Data Cleaning Materials
3. Make sure you're using updated NCES files 
4. Set Directories as follows:
The `cd` command should map to the Vermont folder
`NCES_Schoool` should map to the folder containing NCES .dta files at the school level
`NCES_District ` should map to the folder containing NCES .dta files at the district level
`EDFacts` should map to the folder containing the EDFacts datasets exactly as formatted in the drive, where each year is its own folder.

## Recreating Cleaning Process
- Run the one yearly cleaning do file
- Run the 2016-2017 and 2022 Edfacts files next
