# Tennessee Data Cleaning

This is a ReadMe for TN's cleaning process, from 2010-2024 (excluding 2016)


## Process
Run the files in the following order

1. TN_NCES
2. TN_DTA_Conversion
3. TN_Cleaning_years (doesn't matter which order you run the two yearly do files in)
4. TN_EDFactsParticipationRate
5. TN_StableNames.do

Make sure to download TN_Unmerged_2024.xlsx to your main Tennessee folder before running code.

You may also run the Do_All do-file to fully recreate the cleaning process after you've set appropriate directories.
