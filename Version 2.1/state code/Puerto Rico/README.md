# Puerto Rico Data Cleaning

This is a ReadMe for Puerto Rico's data cleaning process, from 2019 to 2024.

## Setup

There are three main folders you need to create:
1. New Mexico, with the following subfolders:
    - Original Data (download original files from drive)
    - Output

There is 1 .do file currently used:
1. PR_Cleaning_2019_2024

*Note: there is currently an NCES cleaning file in the github. This is not currently used and will only be used if we incorporate school level data.*

    
## File Path

File paths should be specified in the do-file as follows: 

```bash
global Original "/Volumes/T7/State Test Project/Puerto Rico/Original Data Files" //Original Data
global Output "/Volumes/T7/State Test Project/Puerto Rico/Output" //Output
```
