# Colorado Data Cleaning

This is a ReadMe for Colorado's data cleaning process, from 2015 to 2024.
Note that there is no file for 2019-20, as CO did not conduct testing that year due to COVID.

## NCES Setup

NCES_Full: Download the folder from Google Drive-->_Data Cleaning Materials --> NCES District and School Demographics.
    
       a. NCES District Files [subfolder] 

       b. NCES School Files [subfolder]

As of 2/25/2025, the most recent files are from NCES 2022. 

## Setup

Create a folder for CO. Inside that folder, create the following subfolders:
      
      1. Original Data Files: Download the *entire* folder from Google Drive --> Colorado --> Original Data Files. Retain the same folder structure (a subfolder for each year).  
       
         a. Cleaned DTA [subfolder]
         
      2. Temp
         
      3. NCES_CO [will start empty]
           
      4. Output_Files
      
      5. Output_Files_ND: This is a folder for the non-derivation output.

## Process
    Place all do files in the CO folder.
    
    Set the appropriate file paths in CO_Main_File.do
    
    Running CO_Main_File.do will execute all the do files in order.

## Updates

04/10/2024: Updated to pull from 2022 NCES files, derive level counts for 2015 and proficiency counts for 2022, and match updated StudentGroup_TotalTested convention.  Also updated to appropriately address range values.

05/01/2024: Updated to pull in updated NCES fall 2022 data and correct some StudentGroup and StudentSubGroup labels.

09/13/2024: Updated to include 2024 data, derive some additional proficiency information, and match V2.0 conventions.

02/25/25: Modified code to export non-derivation output. Added headers, footers, and notes in each do file. Deleted CO_MostRecentNames.do since the names have been incorporated in the other do files. 

03/12/2025: Updated to retain Spanish Language Arts data from 2021-2024 all students files.
