This is a ReadMe for Idahos's data cleaning process, from 2016 to 2024.

## Setup

The main folders and subfolders needed include:

  1) ID State Testing Data 

    a) Original Data [exactly as downloaded from the Drive, including the subfolders there]
    b) Output
    c) Temp

  2) NCES District and School Demographics

    a) NCES District Files, Fall 1997-Fall 2022  
    b) NCES School Files, Fall 1997-Fall 2022

Download the NCES district and school files and place them in the appropriate folders.

## File Path

The file path setup should be as follows: 

global original_files: Original Data folder

global NCES_files: Folder containing NCES district and school subfolders
global output_files: Folder containing cleaned + merged .dta and .csv files [this folder starts empty]
global temp_files: Folder containing intermediate files saved in the middle of the cleaning process [this folder starts empty]
