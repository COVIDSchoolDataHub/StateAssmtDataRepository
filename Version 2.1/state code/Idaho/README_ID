# Idaho Data Cleaning

This is a ReadMe for Idahos's data cleaning process, from 2016 to 2024.
* Note that 2020 is excluded, as ID did not administer spring tests during that year due to COVID.


## Setup

There are two main folders you need to create: ID State Testing Data and NCES District and School Demographics.
There should be two folders within the NCES folder:
NCES District Files, Fall 1997-Fall 2022 and NCES School Files, Fall 1997-Fall 2022.  Download the NCES district and school files and place them in the appropriate folders.
There should be three folders within the ID State Testing Data folder: Original Data, Output, and Temp. Download the original excel files (including data included in the "Idaho data received from data request 11/27/23" folder on drive), and place them in the Original Data folder.

There are 8 .do files, one for each year.  You can run them in any order you choose.

## File Path

The file path setup should be as follows: 

global original_files: Folder containing original data files
global NCES_files: Folder containing NCES district and school subfolders
global output_files: Folder containing cleaned + merged .dta and .csv files
global temp_files: Folder containing intermediate files saved in the middle of the cleaning process.

```bash
global original_files "/Users/miramehta/Documents/ID State Testing Data/Original Data"
global NCES_files "/Users/miramehta/Documents/NCES District and School Demographics"
global output_files "/Users/miramehta/Documents/ID State Testing Data/Output"
global temp_files "/Users/miramehta/Documents/ID State Testing Data/Temp"
```
## Updates

09/07/2024: Updated to include 2024 data as well as to address new conventions and review standards in version 2.0 (including deriving additional counts based on percentages and StudentSubGroup_TotalTested).
