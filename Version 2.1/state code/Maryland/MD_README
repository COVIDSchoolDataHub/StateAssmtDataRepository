# Maryland Data Cleaning

This is a ReadMe for Maryland's data cleaning process, from 2015 to 2024.

## NCES Setup

NCES_Full: Download the folder from Google Drive-->_Data Cleaning Materials --> NCES District and School Demographics.
    
       a. NCES District Files [subfolder] 

       b. NCES School Files [subfolder]

As of 03/14/2025, the most recent files are from NCES 2022. 

## EDFacts Setup
EDFacts: Download the Datasets subfolder containing *.csv files. There will be individual folders for each year. 

This is located in Google Drive-->_Data Cleaning Materials --> _EDFacts--> Datasets.

## Maryland Setup
Create a folder for MD. Inside that folder, create the following subfolders:

1. Original Data Files: Download the **entire** folder and subfolders from Google Drive --> Maryland --> MD Original Data Files.

   Place these files and subfolders in the Original Data Files folder.

   Retain the same subfolder structure. 
 
   a) DTA [subfolder]

   b) ED Data Express [subfolder]: This is downloaded from the Original Data Files folder.
             
2. Temp:  
         
3. NCES_MD 
      
4. EDFacts_MD 
      
5. Output_Files
      
6. Output_Files_ND: This is a folder for the non-derivation output.

# Process
    Place all do files in the MD folder.
        
    Set the appropriate file paths in MD_Main_File.do
        
    Running MD_Main_File.do will execute all the do files in order.
